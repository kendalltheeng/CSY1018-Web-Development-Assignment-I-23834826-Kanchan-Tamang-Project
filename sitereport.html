            <h1>My Experience Learning Web Development.</h1>
            <h2>I have always been an enthusiast in learning new things.I have quite an interest in Computer and coding too.My aim is to be a UX designer.Therefore i am enhancing my skills and learning whenever i get the opportunity.After joining NAMI College,I have got quite a lot of opportunity to learn new things. One of them being able to learn Web Designing.<br>
                I find Web Designing a very interesting Course.Since it is a very essential part of the internet getting the chance to learn and design website has been quite fun. I went through an emotional rollercoaster ride during learning this module but whenever i was facing any trouble there was my module instructor Mr. Ankit Thapa to help me with the problems i faced while coding.During his unavailabilty i seeked internet for help too.I had quite a difficulty in coding earlier on but slowly I grew fond of it.I faced a lot of trouble while creating navbar but luckily ankit sir helped me out and I was able to fix the problem.In this module i have learned the basics of coding and programming and with the help of my assignment i have enhanced my web development skills even more.In this module i learned everything there is  to in HTML and CSS.With more skill-practice,experience,enthusiasm and dedication i think everyone can make a carrer out of it.Web designing can be a difficult subject to understand but once you get the hang of it, it is very fun and interesting subject to learn!</h2>
